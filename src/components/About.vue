          <span>The foundation of what would later become the Alliance Dota 2 team was laid when Swedish DotA veteran Loda, who had just left Singaporean Team Zenith after their dissolution following The International 2012, was approached by a sponsor (which would later become the Alliance organization) asking him if he was interested in putting together a team.[1] Looking back at the glory days of his early career, his decision was to try to go with an all-swedish lineup in the same spirit as his oldest and most successful team, SK Gaming of the 2008 era. He and fellow Swedish support veteran Akke's, eyes fell upon rising Swedish solo-mid star s4, whom Loda had noticed during their HoN days. s4 and AdmiralBulldog were playing for the new upstart team No Tidehunter created by s4 and Canadian support player EternaLEnVy. In late October 2012, it was announced that Loda and Akke had joined team No Tidehunter,[2] only one month before Dreamhack Winter 2012 which the team had qualified for with a mixed roster including German carry Black^.</span>

          <h1>How low can you go?</h1>
          <span>Winning the DreamHack Winter tournament in such short time after the Swedish veteran duo's inclusion surprised many and established the team as one of the best teams in the west. During the finals, in which they were trailing 0-1, they managed to bait the entire EG squad into checking the Roshan-pit with an ingenious suicide by AdmiralBulldogs Natures Prophet, and subsequently getting the first blood and eventually turning the finals in front of the home crowd.[3] Alliance did not exist as an organization as of yet, but the team confirmed during the event that they were under contract by an unknown organization and that all the players had their trip to Jonk√∂ping paid for, including current captain EternaLEnVy who was flown in all the way from Canada.</span>

          <h1>Marujhiana trench?</h1>
          <span>No Tidehunter continued to dominate the scene with their own style of heavy farming and neutral camp stacking for the rest of 2012 until they began to show their first signs of slowing down in early 2013, starting to lose games in online tournaments in late January and early February 2013. This resulted in some conflicts within the team, which resulted in the team deciding that they needed a change in leadership. This resulted in the co-founder EternaLEnVy stepping down as captain in favour of s4 after the Canadian player was approached by Loda voicing the teams concerns. This only lasted for a week however, and soon after this change it was announced that EternaLEnVy had been dropped from the team and that the team was actively looking for a Swedish replacement.[4]</span>

          <h1>Rock bottom</h1>
          <span>As EGM started to stand-in for No Tidehunter starting with the third EMS One Spring Cup in late February 2013, the classic Alliance roster was born and Loda's second try, the first being CLG which ended when he decided to move to Singapore to play for Zenith, to recreate the glory days of his past with a full Swedish lineup seemed complete, as the up-and-coming Swedish support was integrated seamlessly in the following weeks. With the addition of EGM, nth continued to dominate the western scene despite some people thinking the departure of their former Canadian captain would be the end of their success, and Loda taking a lot of flak from the community for removing the promising young Canadian from the team he created. The team now consisted of two of the most successful Swedish DotA players of all time in in team captain/spiritual leader Loda and support player Akke together with the up-and-coming stars EGM, AdmiralBulldog as well as in-game leader/team strategist and the brightest shining star of the team, solo-mid player s4. The last victory under the nth team name would be the fifth season of the StarLadder StarSeries, as only days after their win in Kiev their mysterious sponsor was announced.</span>
